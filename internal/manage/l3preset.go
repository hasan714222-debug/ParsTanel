// Presets for a full IP tunnel.
//
// The reverse presets and the direct layer-4 ones both tune a mux and a KCP
// layer. A layer-3 tunnel has neither, so none of those fields exist here and
// copying them would produce a config full of keys the engine ignores.
//
// What actually decides how a layer-3 tunnel feels is the queue between the
// kernel and this process, and how much room the carrier's sockets have. Both
// are a trade, and it is not the trade people expect:
//
//   - A deeper queue stops drops during a burst and costs latency the whole
//     rest of the time. 4096 packets of 1400 bytes is 5.7 MB; on a 100 Mbit/s
//     link a full one is most of half a second of delay before a packet is even
//     sent. That delay is the jitter.
//   - Bigger socket buffers stop the kernel dropping datagrams the read loop
//     has not got to yet, and cost memory.
//
// The setting that resolves the first trade is not a number at all — it is the
// queueing discipline. fq_codel measures how long packets are actually waiting
// and drops when the delay climbs, so the queue can be deep enough to absorb a
// burst without becoming latency. Every preset here uses it, which is why the
// difference between them is memory rather than jitter.
//
// What is deliberately absent: anything resembling KCP's nodelay, resend or
// congestion knobs. A layer-3 tunnel carries whole IP packets, and those
// already belong to something that handles its own loss. Adding a retransmit
// timer underneath makes throughput collapse under loss rather than degrade,
// which is why the layer-3 engine has no KCP and no preset here can add one.
