// The MSS clamp exists because one fault in this system is invisible from every
// other angle: a path that cannot carry a full-sized packet and drops the
// oversized ones without an ICMP reply. The tunnel connects, stays up, and
// stalls on every real transfer. Diagnose measures it and names the number;
// SetMSS is where that number goes.
//
// What these tests protect is the join between those two. A check that prints a
// fix the tunnel then refuses is worse than no check at all — it sends the
// operator looking for a setting that will not take the value they were told to
// use, which is exactly the dead end this feature was built to remove.
