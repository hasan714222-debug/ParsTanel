// The obfuscated carriers.
//
// Plain UDP is the right carrier on a path that does not interfere. On one
// that does, it is the first thing to go: a long-lived UDP flow to a foreign
// address is among the easiest patterns to rate-limit or drop. These three
// carry the same sealed datagrams somewhere less obvious.
//
//	pck    raw TCP segments this process builds itself — no socket, no
//	       handshake, no connection state for netfilter to interfere with,
//	       but everything a capture sees is an ordinary TCP flow
//	xdi    ICMP echo, for a path that filters UDP and TCP but not ping
//	spoof  raw IP with a forged source address
//
// Each is an adapter over a constructor that already exists and is already in
// production under the KCP transports. The carriers themselves are untouched:
// what changes is only that the layer-3 tunnel's own sealed datagrams go
// through them instead of KCP's.
//
// All three are Linux-only and need CAP_NET_RAW, which the transports that use
// them already document.

// obfuscatedCarrier wraps a bare net.PacketConn from the network package with
// the overhead and name the tunnel needs.
