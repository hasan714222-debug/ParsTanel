// The engine.
//
// Two pumps and, on the dialling side, a handshake loop. The pumps are
// deliberately dumb: one moves packets from the TUN device to the carrier, the
// other moves them back, and neither knows anything about handshakes. All the
// state that makes a tunnel more than a pipe — which keys are current, which
// are being retired, where the peer is — lives in the small guarded block in
// the middle, and both pumps reach it through accessors.
//
// # Three sessions, not one
//
// A rekey cannot be instantaneous: packets sealed under the old keys are still
// in flight when the new ones come up, and dropping them would put a
// visible stall into every connection through the tunnel every two minutes.
// So a tunnel holds up to three sessions at once, each identified on the wire
// by its own id, and an arriving packet is matched to whichever one sealed it:
//
//   - current is what this end seals with.
//   - previous is the session current replaced. It still decrypts, briefly,
//     so packets already on the path are not lost.
//   - pending exists only on the listening side. See below.
//
// # Why the listener does not trust a handshake immediately
//
// A handshake message is authenticated — it cannot be forged without the token
// — but it can be recorded and sent again. If the listener installed each
// completed handshake as its current session, anyone who had captured one
// could replay it at will and repeatedly tear down the real peer's session,
// which is a denial of service costing one recorded datagram.
//
// So a completed handshake becomes pending, not current. It is promoted only
// when a data packet arrives that authenticates under it, which a replayer
// cannot produce: they would need the session's keys, and those come from an
// ephemeral exchange they cannot repeat. This is the same reasoning WireGuard
// applies to the same problem.
//
// # Learning where the peer is
//
// The listening side does not know its peer's address until it hears from it,
// and a peer's address can change mid-session. The address is therefore taken
// from arriving packets — but only from packets that have authenticated.
// Taking it from an unauthenticated datagram would let anyone redirect the
// tunnel by sending one forged packet from the address of their choice.

const (
	// handshakeRetry is how long the dialling side waits for a reply before

//
// With segmentation offload on, a read does not return packets the kernel built
// to fit this interface. It returns one large run — up to 64 KB — and the
// library splits it into the segments the *sender* chose, whose size came from
// the sender's path and has nothing to do with the MTU here. The split writes
// each segment into the buffer at its index and does not check that it fits, so
// one segment larger than the buffer is not a short read or an error: it is a
// write past the end of a slice, which takes the process down with it.
//
// 64 KB is the bound that makes that impossible rather than unlikely — it is
// the most a single read can return, so no segment of it can be longer. It is
// also what wireguard-go's own device allocates, for this reason.
