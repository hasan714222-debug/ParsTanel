// controlClaimTimeout is how long the server waits for a freshly accepted peer
// to say who it is before dropping it.
//
// It is the server's half of the number the client calls controlAckTimeout, and
// it is generous for the same reason. The token arrives in the first segment
// after the connection is up, so on a lossy path the wait is not a round trip
// but a round trip plus however many retransmissions it takes to land: TCP's
// first retransmission is a second out, the next three, the next seven. Two
// seconds — which is what the udp transport asked for — covers barely one of
// those, so on the kind of path this tunnel exists for the handshake failed,
// the client backed off and dialled again, and the tunnel flapped without ever
// being disconnected in any way the operator could see.
//
// Waiting longer costs one goroutine per silent peer and nothing else:
// admission runs in the connection's own goroutine precisely so that a peer
// which connects and says nothing never delays the ones behind it.

// port on every interface"; anything else is already a full address and is
// handed back untouched.
//
// Every transport used to inline this, and every one of them wrote the range
// check as `port > 1 && port < 65535`. Ports 1 and 65535 are perfectly valid
// and the config validator accepts them, so `1=127.0.0.1:80` fell through to
// the else branch and was passed to the listener as the literal address "1",
// which fails to resolve. Written once, the bound is stated once.

// authorizeWSRequest checks the Authorization header on a websocket upgrade.
//
// Over plain ws there is no session to bind to, so the header carries the token
// itself and is compared to the configured one. Over wss the client sends a
// proof bound to the TLS session instead of the token, and the server recomputes
// the expected proof from its own side of that session; a man in the middle that
// terminated the client's TLS holds a different session and cannot produce it.
// Either way the comparison is constant time, and a wss connection whose keying
// material cannot be exported is rejected rather than waved through.
//
// simpleAuth turns the binding off and compares the raw token even over TLS.
// That is exactly what the binding exists to prevent — anyone who terminates
// the TLS then sees a token they could replay — so it is off by default. It is
// here for one deployment the binding otherwise makes impossible: a TLS
// terminating reverse proxy in front of the tunnel, NGINX being the usual one.
// There the proxy legitimately holds a different TLS session from the client,
// so a bound proof can never match; the operator who puts a trusted proxy there
// is choosing to trust it with the token, which is the same thing the raw ws
// transport already does.
